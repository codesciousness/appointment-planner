# Appointment Planner

Appointment Planner is one of Codecademy's open-ended projects, in which it is encouraged to problem solve and utilize other resources, instead of being provided with step-by-step guidance. The requirements were to utilize functional React components and hooks to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app's external structure was pre-configured and consisted of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments. We were assigned the tasks of implementing the state, functionality and interactivity of the functional React components.
